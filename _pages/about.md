I am a postdoc at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/){:target="\_blank"} with [Aviv Regev](https://www.roche.com/about/leadership/aviv-regev){:target="\_blank"} and [Tommaso Biancalani](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/tommaso-biancalani){:target="\_blank"}.

I am interested in how machines learn rich and reliable representations of complex data. My work explores **representation learning**, **self-supervised** and **multi-modal methods**, **optimal transport**, and **dimensionality reduction**. I develop computational approaches that uncover structure in data, motivated by challenges in the life sciences.

I enjoy building and sharing open-source tools, including:

- [TorchDR](https://github.com/TorchDR/TorchDR){:target="\_blank"} : a modular, GPU-friendly toolbox for **dimensionality reduction** (DR) that offers a unified interface for state-of-the-art DR methods.
- [stable-pretraining](https://github.com/rbalestr-lab/stable-pretraining){:target="\_blank"} : a PyTorch library for **self-supervised learning** and foundation model pretraining with real-time training monitoring.

I did my PhD in the [math department](http://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/){:target="\_blank"} of [ENS Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/){:target="\_blank"} on [_Optimal Transport and Probabilistic Modeling for Dimensionality Reduction_](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04997083/document){:target="\_blank"}.
Prior to my PhD, I was a student at [Ecole polytechnique](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien){:target="\_blank"} and [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/){:target="\_blank"}.
