My primary research interests are in **unsupervised** and **self-supervised learning**. I develop computational methods that leverage **optimal transport** and **probabilistic modeling** to compute robust and grounded data representations suitable for real-world applications. I am especially interested in applying these methods to tackle challenges in cell biology.

I am a strong advocate for open and accessible science through projects such as:

* [TorchDR](https://github.com/TorchDR/TorchDR){:target="\_blank"} : a modular, GPU-friendly toolbox for **dimensionality reduction** (DR) that offers a unified interface for state-of-the-art DR methods.
* [Stable-SSL](https://github.com/rbalestr-lab/stable-SSL){:target="\_blank"} : a library offering essential boilerplate code for a wide range of **self-supervised learning** tasks.

While finalizing my PhD thesis in the [math department](http://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/){:target="\_blank"} of [ENS Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/){:target="\_blank"}, I am currently a visiting research fellow at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/){:target="\_blank"} working with [Randall Balestriero](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/rbalestr){:target="\_blank"}. Prior to my PhD, I was a student at [Ecole polytechnique](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien){:target="\_blank"} and [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/){:target="\_blank"} master ([CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/CV.pdf)).
