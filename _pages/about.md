My primary research interests are in **unsupervised and self-supervised learning**. I develop computational methods that leverage **optimal transport** and **probabilistic modeling** to compute robust and grounded data representations suitable for real-world applications. I am especially interested in applying these methods to tackle challenges in cell biology.

I am a strong advocate for open and accessible science through projects such as:

* [TorchDR](https://github.com/TorchDR/TorchDR){:target="\_blank"} : a modular, GPU-friendly toolbox for **dimensionality reduction** (DR) that offers a unified interface for state-of-the-art DR methods.

I am a PhD student in the department of Mathematics ([UMPA](http://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/){:target="\_blank"}) of [Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/){:target="\_blank"} with [Aurélien Garivier](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/aurelien.garivier/www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/_agarivie/index.html){:target="\_blank"} and [Titouan Vayer](https://tvayer.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}.

I am currently a visiting research fellow at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/){:target="\_blank"} in the [CS department](https://cs.brown.edu/){:target="\_blank"} with [Randall Balestriero](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/rbalestr){:target="\_blank"}. Before my PhD, I was a student at [Ecole polytechnique](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien){:target="\_blank"} and [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/){:target="\_blank"} master ([CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/CV.pdf)).
